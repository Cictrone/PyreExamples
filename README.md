# PyreExamples

## Overview
There are four sub projects in here to show off some pyre static anlysis :)
- Flask RCE
- Flask Secret Logging
- Flask XSS
- Flask XSS Sanitized

## Run
Make sure to be in the base dir in the project and have pyre already installed (read [here](https://pyre-check.org/docs/installation.html) to set pyre up). Next you will want to run `pyre analyze` and boom, your done.

## Output
The output should be the following:
